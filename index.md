# Face Scanning Using Python

This project demonstrates how to perform **face detection and recognition** using Python libraries such as:

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition)
- [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface)

The system can:
- Detect faces in images and video streams
- Recognize known faces
- Compare similarity between two images
- Integrate with APIs or GUI applications
